// comprehension syntax is inspired by scala's for, and is compiled in almost identical way
// the following two statements are equivalent
var x = for(i <- [1 to 10]) yield i * 2
var x = [1 to 10].map(i -> i * 2)

// you can also use filters and newlines or semicolons as separators
// there's also a statement variant, that compiles to forEach

    y <- [1 to x]
    if (x + y) % 2 === 0
