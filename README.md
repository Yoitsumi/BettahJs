#BettahJs
(I need a better name)
Yet another js transpiler, heavily inspired by scala and clumsiness of javascript's syntax
###Features:
- Lambdas
- Pattern matching
- Ruby-style call blocks
- For comprehensions inspired by scala
- Range syntax

###Planned for near future:
- Better error messages
- Continuations
- Pattern matching in function defs and lambdas
